## 1. Front-End Development

### **1.1 Project Setup**
   - **Folders and Files**: 
     - Set up your folder structure for `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and assets (images, icons).
     - Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` files.

### **1.2 Layout Design**
   - **Main Pages**:
     - Home Page (`index.html`): Brief description and links to other sections.
     - Support Ticket Page: Form to submit support requests.
     - FAQ Page: Commonly asked questions with collapsible answers.
     - Contact Page: Form for users to send messages to your email.
   - **Styling**:
     - Apply CSS for layout, typography, and colors.
     - Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind (optional) to simplify styling.

### **1.3 Interactive Features**
   - **Support Form Validation**: 
     - Use JavaScript to validate input fields (e.g., required fields).
   - **Google Login Integration**:
     - Set up the Google Sign-In API, displaying a login button and handling user login states.
   - **FAQ Dropdowns**: 
     - Create collapsible sections for FAQ answers using JavaScript or CSS.
   - **Basic Animations**: 
     - Add hover effects, transitions, and animations for a user-friendly experience.

## 2. Back-End Development

### **2.1 Initial Setup**
   - **Server Selection**:
     - Choose a server-side language (Node.js with Express is a good option).
   - **Basic Routes**:
     - Define routes for the Home, Support Ticket, FAQ, and Contact sections.

### **2.2 API and Authentication**
   - **Google Login API**:
     - Set up OAuth 2.0 for Google login. Ensure the back-end can securely handle user data.
   - **REST API**:
     - Develop endpoints for ticket submission, FAQ retrieval, and contact form submissions.
     - Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) for interaction.

### **2.3 Business Logic**
   - **Ticket Creation**:
     - Handle ticket submissions by storing form data and generating unique ticket IDs.
   - **Email Functionality**:
     - Integrate an email API (like SendGrid or Nodemailer) to send contact form submissions to your email address.

## 3. Database Setup

### **3.1 Database Choice**
   - Choose a database (e.g., MongoDB for NoSQL or MySQL for SQL).
   - Set up a cloud-hosted database (MongoDB Atlas or Firebase) if needed.

### **3.2 Database Schema**
   - **User Collection**:
     - Store user details, especially for users logged in via Google.
   - **Tickets Collection**:
     - Store ticket ID, user ID, description, status (e.g., open, resolved), and timestamps.
   - **FAQ Collection**:
     - Store question, answer, and category fields for easier FAQ management.

### **3.3 Database Integration**
   - **Database Connection**:
     - Connect the back-end to your database. Ensure database environment variables are secured.
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for support tickets, FAQs, and user profiles.

## 4. Integration and Testing

### **4.1 Front-End and Back-End Communication**
   - Use AJAX or fetch API to communicate between front-end and back-end.

### **4.2 Testing**
   - **Functionality Tests**:
     - Test user logins, ticket submission, FAQ retrieval, and contact form.
   - **End-to-End Testing**:
     - Ensure each feature works as expected, from Google login to ticket submission.

## 5. Deployment

### **5.1 Hosting**
   - Use platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel** for front-end.
   - Use **Heroku** or **Render** for back-end hosting.

### **5.2 Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for database credentials and Google API keys in your production environment.

## 6. Maintenance and Future Enhancements

   - **User Account Management**: Allow users to track the status of their tickets.
   - **Admin Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for admins to view and manage support tickets.
   - **Notification System**: Implement email or SMS notifications for ticket updates.
